  <h2>1. Grocery Shopping & Cooking</h2>
  <p> Living abroad gave me the chance to learn how to cook in order to survive.
    <br>
I'm forever grateful for the vast categories of products that American markets have shown me.
</p>

  <h2>2. Reading, Writing, and Editing</h2>

  <p> I've always loved reading English fictions ever since I was young.
    <br>
It gave me the chance to polish my English comprehension, and I guess the efforts I'd made have paid off :) 
</p>

  <h2>3. Exploring New Music</h2>

  <p> Shoutout to Spotify and their personalized album for me!
</p>
