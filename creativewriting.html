  <h1>... Well, here goes nothing.</h1>
  <p>
    As 2022 comes to a close, I want to say a few words to the months that have given me the most erratic ride of my life (as of now).
<br>
<br>

January, you made me sad with how I had to say goodbye to my mom and brother on the first week. You made me nervous since you started the Spring semester. I was able to toughen up, though.
<br>
<br>
February, you gave me nothing but darkness as the winter reached its peak over you. I barely remembered anything except for the fact that I had to simply survive. I pushed through — we all pushed through.
<br>
<br>
March, you brought the sun out of its sleep, even though it was not much. I slowly got my energy back, but still my heart was stuck dead inside. There was light somewhere, though.
<br>
<br>
April, you made me look forward to the end of the semester, but I disliked you a lot because your dates reminded me of the exams I must take. Still, I think I got a bit better. I cried, and I laughed a lot.
<br>
<br>
May — my dearest May. You've always been my favorite month because I was born when you roll. I celebrated my first birthday abroad and I had my first ever internship during you, too. It was very challenging, but I learnt so much. I started to feel alive.
<br>
<br>

June and July, you gave me the chance to come back home and reunite with my beloved people. You gave me new activities, friends, chances to recharge, and so much more. I remembered crying and feeling scared, but it was okay because the next day I looked around me and I saw my people. Damn, you guys made me dependent.
<br>
<br>

August, you made me desperate for a time machine — or at the very least, a non-stop rewind buffer. I'm glad though, that my heart was strong when I went back to study and faced the new semester.
<br>
<br>

September, you uplifted my confidence as I swim through my responsibilities as a junior. New classes, new internship program — they all were challenging but you were the beginning, so everything was as good as it could've been. The concert was fun, too.
<br>
<br>

October, I can't believe you allowed an endless train of exam to bulldoze through my semester. I mean — you should've given me a break, shouldn't you? My mind was a tornado! 
<br>
<br>

November, you made me want to rip my hair out. I could barely think straight — it was honestly sad how I allowed myself to spiral down and away. Everything was too much and it was hard to see ahead of me.
<br>
<br>

December, December, December. You were the bittersweet cookie I had to chew slowly this time. I loved that you gave me another chance to reunite with my loved ones, but I hated the fact that you made me realize a ton of things that I had to prepare for next year — in a short amount of time. You made me think about myself and my mind, that moving forward with my own strength shouldn't be part of my long-term plan. You made me think about the relationships that I've thought I had and fought so hard to maintain — that maybe it is time to slowly let go. You made me think that breathing in the new air isn't supposed to be scary, but it is reality that change is truly inevitable. It's not about what's around me, but it's about how I respond to what's given to me.
<br>
<br>

All in all, you guys are annoying and I'm butt-tired from your antics, but I'm very thankful for what you've given me, and I hope you on the next year will be way better than you guys this year. Not because you will be the ones improving, but it's me that will continue to grow into the human that I'm called to be.

<br>
<br> 
<br>
with love, Jocelyn
